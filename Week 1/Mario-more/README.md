## Overview

In this C program, we recreate the pyramids seen at the beginning of World 1-1 in Super Mario Brothers using text characters. Hashes (#) represent bricks in a pyramid formation. The program, named `mario`, allows users to determine the height of the pyramids by inputting a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive.
