# CS50-Lab-Population-Growth

This simple C program explores the growth and dynamics of a llama population over the years.

## Overview

Say we have a population of n llamas. Each year, n / 3 new llamas are born, and n / 4 llamas pass away. This program calculates the number of years required for the llama population to grow from a given starting size to a desired end size.

## Example

Let's illustrate this with an example:
- Starting with n = 1200 llamas, in the first year, 400 new llamas are born, and 300 llamas pass away. The result is a total of 1300 llamas at the end of the year.

Another example:
- If we start with n = 1000 llamas, at the end of the year, we would have 333 new llamas (truncated from 333.33 due to practicality) and 250 llamas passing away. This leads to a total of 1083 llamas at the end of the year.

## Implementation Details

The program will prompt you for the starting and ending population sizes, ensuring that they meet the necessary criteria for realistic llama population growth. It will then calculate and display the number of years required for the llama population to reach the specified end size.
