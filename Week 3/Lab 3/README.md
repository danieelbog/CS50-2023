# Sorting Algorithm Investigation

You've got three mysterious sorting programs: `sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3`. Each seems to implement a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort (order unknown). Your mission: figure out which one is which.

## Instructions:

1. You've got three compiled C programs: `sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3`.
2. Run them on different sets of values provided in .txt files.
3. Files have n lines of reversed, shuffled, or sorted numbers.
4. Example: `reversed10000.txt` has 10,000 reversed numbers; `random10000.txt` has 10,000 shuffled numbers.
5. Use terminal: `./[program_name] [text_file.txt]` (Remember to use `cd` to navigate to the right directory).
6. Time your sorts: `time ./[sort_file] [text_file.txt]` to see how long it takes.

## Recording your findings:

Record your results in `answers.txt` and explain each program. Look for the blanks marked `TODO` and fill them in.
